/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes strict user-ownership and admin-based authorization.
 * Data shapes are not strictly enforced to allow for rapid iteration.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Admin role assignments. Document existence grants admin privileges.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data, accessible only by the owning user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Write operations without authentication are strictly forbidden.
 * - Data validation is limited to authorization-critical fields to enable flexible prototyping.
